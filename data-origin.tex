\begin{abstract}
The goal of the document is to make the Data Origin more visible in the query results executed in the Virtual Observatory. 
The document lists meta-data required to provide sufficient traceability to end-users in order to improve the understanding 
of the resultsets and enabling its reuse and its citation.

\section{Introduction}

Data Origin is required for end users to understand data, for citation and for reusability. The  provenance is cited as a mandatory criterion in the EOSC or in RDA FAIR definition. 

The virtual observatory provides an advanced framework to search and consume data provided by Data Centers or Space Agencies who apply curation in different level.  In this context, Data Origin in output includes meta-data from the data producer (author, space agency) and the Data Center which hosts the resource. 
Depending of the implementation, the users can find the origin information in the Data center web pages (landing pages) or in the Registries of the Virtual Observatory. For citation, ADS (Astrophysics Data System, Nasa) provides citation capabilities with bibtex output. There are no VO standards to get the information easily yet. For instance, the origin meta-data are not included neither in output format, nor in protocols used to access the data.
A list of basics meta-data added in strategic location (as result output or resource listing) would give easier the authors search who is looking for how to cite VO resources. Tracing Data Origin, from the producer to the final query enables also to report to end users the different agents implied in the data preservation (authors, data center, space agencies, journal)- especially when data can be subject to a curation  which depends of the different agents.
We propose to list the meta-data which responds to the need of Provenance and methods available today for their implementations.

% all lines not relevant to your standard.
% Notes don't generally need this.  If you don't copy role_diagram.xml,

\section{Use cases}

\begin{itemize}
	\item (Data Origin information) A researcher has data in a VOTable that shows an odd feature. They would now like to talk to the creator of the data to help figure out whether that feature is physics or an artefact. 
	
	Requirement: contact information to producers present; but then let's not make that a MUST: This can be GDPR-relevant data, and it must be possible to leave it out if it is
	
	The researcher completes his understanding with Data Origin information easily accessible from the VOTable, and this, regardless of the service which generated the result. For instance, a URL that links an article. 
	
	The information could contain the Author, the year of publication, related resources like an article or the original data URL.
	
	When data provided by the service is derived from external resources, or if the data were performed with an additional curation, the nature and links to external resources are available.
	
	For instance, a table published in a journal or by a Space Agency is also hosted in a Data Center like CDS, GAVO, etc. The data curation depends of the Data Center which can add associated data, enrich meta-data (eg: add filter for magnitude) or make a sub-selection of columns. [an advanced serialisation could be based on DOI vocabulary "isVariantFormOf", "IsDerivedFrom", ...]
	
	\item (Reproducibility) A researcher revisits work they did six months earlier in an ad-hoc fashion and would now like to reproduce it in a more structured fashion. To do that, they need to know, say, which queries against which services, or perhaps which programs, produced the files. 
	
	Requirement: have the request parameters and a service identification (access url? ivoid?) in Data Origin.
	
	\item (Citation) While preparing a publication, a researcher would like to properly cite the software and data that went into their results. They now run a program to extract that information from the digital artefacts going into the publication -- perhaps even in separate parts of citations and acknowledgments. 
	
	Requirement: The Data Origin must indicate requests for citation and/or acknowledgment in a machine-readable way, preferably in a way that machines can generate BibTeX for whatever they specify
	
	The information allows the researcher to fill the template citation asked by journals.
	
	Example (American Astronomical Society template):
	
	"we searched optical astrometric data of these sources from the Gaia (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016) Early Data Release 3 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021) via the Gaia archive (Gaia Collaboration 2020)."*
	
	\item (workflow) Give me a bibliography of everything I've used in the workflow"
	The VOTable resulting of a session contains homogenized metadata that can be merged and compared.
	
\end{itemize}

The basics meta-data should contain Data Origin (space agency or authors, article references), the data center providing the resource, the date of publication ...

\section{State of the art}

VOTable as well as IVOA protocols don't provide any Data Origin information. For instance the TAP protocols provides tables and columns description in order to query tables. The TAP metadata contains information like unit, type and text information. Authors, publication date or identifiers are not included in the TAP description.

Hips is a more recent protocol which includes for each Dataset (HiPS) a list of standardized metadata. HiPS metadata include authors, publication year, Data center identifier or licenses.


\subsection{Data Origin in IVOA registry}
IVOA registries may contain in its metadata the Data Origin like authors, publication date, references and alternate identifiers like DOI for each of its resources.\\
eg: $<altIdentifier>doi:10.26093/cds/vizier.1355</altIdentifier>$

The VO registries are available to index any services and resources hosted by data-producers, data-centers. 
The VO registries provide an open framework without any moderators. The data are regularly harvested by registry-of-registries which check the descriptions of services/resources. However, the IVOA  doesn't guaranty the resources sustainability.

The IVOA registries provides a unique identifier (the ivo-id) to each resources in the Registry. This ivo-id has not been considered to be citable in articles yet, because it is a technical identifier and because resources sustainability is not required in the IVOA publication process.

However, the registry metadata schema is based on Scholix and Datacite schemas. It opens citation capabilities with combining the metadata required to provide bibtex.

\subsection{Data Origin serialisation}
Today Provenance and DatasetDM are models that can be used to serialize Data Origin.

The Provenance Data Model (ProvDM) is based on Entities, Agents and Activities which are defined in the W3C Provenance. The model is dedicated to serialize workflow,
it is a recursive model that can be serialized in JSON or RDF. 

The ProvDM serialization needs mivot to be serialized in VOTable. But the recursive model and the metadata serialization which is subject to the producer implementation, are obstacles for its reusability.


The "Last-Step-Provenance" is a Provenance extension (not a standard) which gather a list of metadata which matches with Data Origin. Its output is not recursive and could be easily serialized in a table.


DatasetDM provides a table description which includes Data Origin information like authors, date of publication, links to bibliography, etc.
DatasetDM is not a standard yet.

\subsection{DALI}
DALI is a protocol basis , used for instance in TAP. It includes services to  check the availability and capabilities of a service. It includes also information in the VOTable output format as the request STATUS or the REQUEST query.


\section{Expected Data Origin}

List of expected metadata:

\begin{itemize}
\item Author : name or ORCID of the Data producer (human)
\item Organization:  name, ROR or URL of the Data producer (organization)
\item Editor : name or URL  of the editor (when data are attached to a publication)
\item Journal : name or URL of the reference journal (when data are attached to a publication)
\item Datacenter : name, ROR or URL of the data center who hosts the data 
\item Contact : Data Center email 
\item Resource Identifier : ivoid of resource(s) hosted by the service which provides the result
\item Resource citation : DOI, bibcode of resource(s) hosted by the Data Center which returns the result 
\item Original resource identifier : remote/original resource which was used to build the result
\item Publication date : publication date in the Data Center 
\item Original Publication date :  publication date of the original resource
\item Curation level : curation level in the Data Center
\item Operation : Operation as cutout, add-values executed on Data-center on the original data
\item License : (original) licenses - machine-readable URI is preferred
\item Data version : version or release
\item Access protocol :  eg.TAP query, SCS, ... 
\item Query : eg: ADQL 
\item Version : version or date of Data-center software
\item ... (\textbf{to complete?})
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Condition for citation}
\textbf{I don't know if it is the place to talk about that??}

The DOI is the privileged persistent identifier to cite resources.\\

Data Citation requires a sustainable URL which is not guarantied in IVOA resources. 
Unlike ivoid, the DOI guaranties a sustainable URL and should be used for citation. \\

Bibtex requires curation that needs metadata like identifier, authors, title, publisher and date of publication. 
ADS (NASA) provides a citation capability for its indexed resources. This curation quality has to be privileged or may be took as example for any data providers and users.

For instance, DOI providers like Datacite, provides a bibtex capability. The bibtex quality depends of the DOI metadata filled by the Data producers and publishers.\\

The IVOA registry which contains metadata for any resources could be used to get the expected quality for citation if the following conditions are met:
\begin{itemize}
\item the registry resource includes a persistent identifier (DOI)
\item the registry resource includes the metadata which meets the bibtex requirements
\end{itemize}




\section{Data Origin in VOTable}

The metadata listed bellow combines terms from DALI (REC-DALI-1.1), Dublin Core (DC: Dublin core, RFC 2413) and extensions in order to reproduce and to provide Data Origin information to end users.

\subsection{Query information}
Query information enables to link the registry and to reproduce the query. For queries on evolving dataset, the version or the date must complete the information.\\

\end{tabular}\\



\subsection{VOTable serialization}

In this document, we focused on a basic serialization that allows description implying individual tables.
This output is adapted for protocol like the Simple Conesearch.

The basic serialization uses INFO tags to populate Data Origin (see the example of a ConeSearch result in appendix  \ref{appendixA}).
INFO tags are allowed in a VOTable under $VOTABLE$ element or in RESOURCE elements.
It is then possible to annotate a collection of TABLE which are in different RESOURCEs.


Complex query (for instance, a join in a TAP query) needs an advanced output serialization to gather metadata by resource. 
Mechanisms to manage this requirement are being developed in IVOA (mivot). 
This output is not treated in the current version of the document. 



%\subsubsection{Complex output involving several tables (eg: TAP query, ObsCore result)}
%Dataset-origin depends on each table used for the output. Datamodels like Last-step -Provenance or DatasetDM allows to gather the metadata.
